		I have an extense list of hobbies that change a lot in brief periods of time, but maybe the ones that have stuck with me are solving algorithmic problems (related usually to their time complexity), snowboarding, reading (I'm a big fan of science fiction) and watching old movies of the 70s and the 80s.

		Lately I've been enjoying driving to remote places (I love driving) and spend a whole day trekking surrounded by nature and relaxing.

              My first professional experience in IT, in the shape of an internship after the aforementioned administrator degree course.
              <br>
              It was a very nice experience surrounded by people that had a lot of knowledge, which helped me learn about a ton of new different things.
              <br>
              Had the chance to work with some Content Management Systems like Alfresco, and also helped in various programming projects written in Java.

              After my internship with G.F.I. I started to work for MAHOU SM, a very famous beer producer in Spain which exports to many places in the world.
              <br><br>
              It was a work with very harsh working schedules, but interesting in the way that I got to operate and manage many different industrial machines (and I'm into robotics).
              <br>
              <br>
              More importantly, the financial conditions were a major improvement, which allowed me to think about an university degree.

              Started my degree in 2013 with the money I had saved up and full of energy. When the classes started and I got to taste what "engineering" meant it was even better, because I knew I belonged there, and  that my decision to start the degree had been a good one.
              <br>
              <br>
			  During the four years the degree took me, I continued to work for MAHOU SM occasionally to afford the expenses of the degree and contribute to the family finances.

              <br>
              Graduated with honors in 6 different expertises, with an average grade of 8.1 over 10, which is much more than what I had expected.
              <br>
              <br>
              More importantly, I got to know a lot of wonderful people, both in the student and the teaching groups, and shared amazing experiences with them, like the programming contests I am so fond of today.
